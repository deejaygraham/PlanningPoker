Pngs of Planning Poker cards used in story estimation. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker">Wikipedia</a> for a description.

There are three decks currently:

* Fibonnacci (traditional)
* Modified Fibonnacci (more coarse grained for higher values)
* T-Shirt sizes (for summer !)

Each "deck" consists of 17 "suits", way more than you would need traditionally need but included so you can pick your favourite colours :)
